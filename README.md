# UnitySimpleCharacterControllers
Sample 2D Character Controllers, for students to reference.

All contained in the "Blooper" namespace.

# Grid Snap Controller
A controller for moving a player in a grid-style game, with instant snapping. "position" based movement.

# AsteroidsCharacterController
A controller that uses rigidbody2D forces to accelerate, rotate a player. "Acceleration" based movement.

# Platformer Character Controller
A pretty bad platformer controller, missing lots of features and is buggy. But demonstrates how one would get started using raycasts instead of a rigidbody to move a player in this way. It'll take work to make it feel good, but there are bones here.
